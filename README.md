- `data/flight_incidents.csv`: CSV file containing the flight incident data.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing Python dependencies for the project.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Euodia15/flight-incident-analysis.git

2. Install required dependencies:

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook flight_incident_analysis.ipynb.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, perform the analysis, and generate visualizations.
3. The analysis includes:
  - The top operators with the most incidents.
